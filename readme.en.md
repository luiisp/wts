WTS is a Google Chrome extension that facilitates searching for terms/keywords on web pages. Simply enter the term to be searched, and WTS will search for matches on the current web page.

### How did the idea for WTS come about?
The idea arose from a personal experience. When reading extensive API documentation, I constantly needed to refer back to sections of the documentation to recall what I had read previously. However, due to the length of the document, this manual task became very tiresome. That's when the idea of â€‹â€‹creating an extension that would facilitate searching for terms/keywords on the web page emerged.

### How does WTS work?
WTS captures the term to be searched and searches for all occurrences of the term on the current web page, highlighting the found occurrences and providing the option to navigate between them.
